Cycle 1 report:
We each spent a few hours working on the current deliverable. Our current
project includes three different levels that can be loaded from files. These
levels can be switched between when you press the U and D keys. In addition
the player character can be moved using the arrow keys. As of now the levels
only contain non-poisoned mushrooms, which have no character collision.
